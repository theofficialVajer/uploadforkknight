**#Guide and Rules**

Hello!
I am theofficialVajer (aka. Vajer).
I do coding often, and i need to use some place for me to upload my files (e.g. pictures) and use them for my code. 
This is the most effective way i found, so i use this method. 
Anyone can take my files but please quote me anywhere on the page (or wherever u use my files). 
Also please note that not all of the files uploaded here are my property; if not mine, i may link them to the file. 
Thank You!


**ALL FILES ARE A PROPERTY OF THIS GITHUB REPO; DONT USE WITHOUT QUOTING**
